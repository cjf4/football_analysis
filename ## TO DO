## TO DO

1. Build second train/test dataset that goes based off of offense/defense score rather than home/away

2. Apply K-folds cross validation (only needed for logistic regression, random forest accomplishes the same result)

3. Build RF Model with a variety of different ntree sizes

4. Build bagging model (where m feature choices = p predictors at each cut)

5. (Optional) Build logistic regression model.

6. Use built models to fit to TEST data and predict outcomes

7. measure outcome success and compare against each other
	-k folds of 5-10 range yields optimal bias variance trade off, could use for logistic regression

8. select model and build "binning" example, where WPs are binned in .05 increments, and compared to actuall results for that bin.
	-simply predict the team thats winning every time
	-also can compare models to simply predicting the team that's winning each time.

9. Fit WP to all data

10. Calculate WPA for each play

11. Pull in stats necessary for Passer Rating

12. Select a subset of games

13. caluclate total passer rating for those games, and total WPA of passing plays for those games

14. compare which has a stronger correlative effect.



NOTES

-Other approach could include KNN clustering with a large amount of clusters, and calculating the WP for each cluster
